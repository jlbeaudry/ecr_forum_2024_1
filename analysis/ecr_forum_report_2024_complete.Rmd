```

We asked our attendees five questions. Two were about the forum, one was about
other training and development offerings that they would like, one was about how 
they want us to communicate opportunities to them, and one was an open-ended 
question giving them a chance to tell us anything else they wanted us to know. 

Of the `r attendees` early career researchers who attended this session, `r nrow(df)` 
completed the survey.

## Feedback about today's DVC(R) forum with ECRs
What did you think about today's forum?

```{r table for feedback}

# use for complete report and report for DVCR

# put relevant data in a tibble
feedback <- df %>% 
  dplyr::select(c(id, feedback)) %>% 
  filter(!feedback == "NA") %>%  # remove the NA values
  mutate(responses = 1:n()) %>% 
  relocate(responses, .after = id)

# get the relevant ns for the header
total_n <- length(unique(df$id))
resp_n <- length(unique(feedback$id))
ns <- c(total_n, resp_n) 

feedback <- feedback %>% 
  dplyr::select(c(id, feedback))

knitr::kable (
  feedback,
  booktabs = T,
  linesep = "\\addlinespace",
  col.names = c("ID", "ECR Forum Feedback"),
  caption =
    sprintf("From the %s people responded to this question", paste(ns, collapse = " completed surveys, ")),
  align = 'cl', 
  longtable = T #break the table over multiple pages
  ) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "5.5in") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, 
                latex_options = c("repeat_header", "hold_position")) 
# use different styling to repeat the header


```


## Ideas for the DVC(R) forum with ECRs
What would you like to see in future fora with the DVC(R)?

```{r table for forum ideas}

# use for complete report and report for DVCR

# put relevant data in a tibble
forum_ideas <- df %>% 
  dplyr::select(c(id, future_fora)) %>% 
  filter(!future_fora == "NA") %>%  # remove the NA values
  mutate(responses = 1:n()) %>% 
  relocate(responses, .after = id)

# get the relevant ns for the header
total_n <- length(unique(df$id))
resp_n <- length(unique(forum_ideas$id))
ns <- c(total_n, resp_n)

## Ideas for other training and development opportunities
What other researcher training and development opportunities would you like to see
at Flinders?

```{r table for other training}

# put relevant data in a tibble
other_training <- df %>% 
  dplyr::select(c(id, training)) %>% 
  filter(!training == "NA") %>%  # remove the NA values
  mutate(responses = 1:n()) %>% 
  relocate(responses, .after = id)

# get the relevant ns for the header
total_n <- length(unique(df$id))
resp_n <- length(unique(other_training$id))
ns <- c(total_n, resp_n) 

other_training <- other_training %>% 
  dplyr::select(c(id, training))

knitr::kable (
  other_training,
  booktabs = T,
  linesep = "\\addlinespace",
  col.names = c("ID", "Other Training Ideas"),
  caption =
    sprintf("From the %s people responded to this question", paste(ns, collapse = " completed surveys, ")),
  align = 'cl', 
  longtable = T #break the table over multiple pages
  ) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "5.5in") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, 
                latex_options = c("repeat_header", "hold_position")) 
# use different styling to repeat the header


```

## Communication preferences
How do you prefer to find out about researcher training and development opportunities
(e.g., targeted emails, College newsletters, Research Link weekly newsletter, all of the above)? 


```{r recode comms}

# put relevant data in a tibble (will need this for the table, so do not combine
  # with tibble below)

comms <- df %>% 
  dplyr::select(c(id, comms_preference)) %>% 
  filter(! comms_preference == "NA") %>%  # remove the NA values
  mutate(responses = 1:n()) %>% 
  relocate(responses, .after = id) %>% 
    mutate(length = str_length(comms_preference)) %>% # I could delete these when I'm done playing
  mutate(text_report = case_when (length > 20 ~ "yes", 
                                  TRUE ~ "no"))

# put relevant data in a tibble
comms_recode <- comms %>% 
  mutate(college_newsletter = str_detect(comms_preference, regex("College", ignore_case = T))) %>% 
  mutate(emails = str_detect(comms_preference, regex("email", ignore_case = T))) %>% 
  mutate(researchlink = str_detect(comms_preference, regex("Link", ignore_case = T))) %>% 
  mutate(all = str_detect (comms_preference, regex("all", ignore_case = T)))

total_n <- length(comms_recode$id)

# SELECT THE RATING COLUMNS & SAVE AS A TIBBLE I WANT TO SUMMARISE & PLOT USING THE RATING_SUMMARY FUNCTION

comms_options <- comms_recode %>% 
  select (c("college_newsletter", 
            "emails", 
            "researchlink", 
            "all")) 
  
columns <- c("college_newsletter", 
            "emails", 
            "researchlink", 
            "all")

comms_summary <- purrr::map_dfr(columns, .f = function(column) {
	ratings_summary(comms_options, column)
})

# rename the comms options as well as the true and false

comms_summary <- comms_summary %>% 
  mutate(comm_options = case_when(rating_item == "college_newsletter" ~ "College newsletters",
                               rating_item == "emails" ~ "Targeted emails",
                               rating_item == "researchlink" ~ "Research Link",
                               TRUE ~ "All of the above")) %>% 
  mutate(response = case_when(rating == "TRUE" ~ "Mentioned", 
                              TRUE ~ "Not mentioned"))

```


Of the `r total_n` respondents, many of them repeated the options included
in the question text. As such, we recoded their responses and we report them in 
the figure below. Several respondents mentioned more than one of the communication
channels. 

```{r plot the comms_summary responses}

# use this to reorder the factor within the ggplot code rather than doing it 
  # in its own code

mention <- c("Not mentioned", "Mentioned")


# plot it [this works & shows all numbers]
ggplot(comms_summary, aes(fill = factor(response, levels = mention), y = percentage, x = comm_options)) +
  geom_bar(position="fill", stat="identity", colour = "black") +
  # add text to show the percentage numbers on the figure for selected responses
  geom_text(aes(y = percentage, x = comm_options, label = percentage), position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5), size = 3) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#d2e2f0", "#2171b5"),
                    labels = c("Not mentioned", "Mentioned"), 
                    guide = guide_legend (reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs (x = element_blank(),
        y = "Percentage") +
  theme_classic() +
theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
    coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = c("0", "25", "50", "75", "100"))


```


```{r table for comms}

# use the comms tibble

comms2 <- comms %>% 
  mutate(length = str_length(comms_preference)) %>% 
  mutate(text_report = case_when (length > 24 ~ "yes", 
                                  TRUE ~ "no")) 
 # mutate(text_report2 = case_when (id == "10" ~ "no",
#                                  id == "18" ~ "no",
 #                                 id == "23" ~ "no",
  #                                id == "26" ~ "no",
   #                               TRUE ~ text_report))

comms <- comms2 %>% 
  filter (text_report == "yes") %>%

  ) %>%

                latex_options = c("repeat_header", "hold_position"))

## Final comments
Is there anything else you would like us to know?

```{r table for anything else}

# put relevant data in a tibble
anything <- df %>% 
  dplyr::select(c(id, anything_else)) %>% 
  filter(!anything_else == "NA") %>%  # remove the NA values
  mutate(responses = 1:n()) %>% 
  relocate(responses, .after = id)

# get the relevant ns for the header
total_n <- length(unique(df$id))
resp_n <- length(unique(anything$id))
ns <- c(total_n, resp_n) 

anything <- anything %>% 
  dplyr::select(c(id, anything_else))

knitr::kable (
  anything,
  booktabs = T,
  linesep = "\\addlinespace",
  col.names = c("ID", "Other Ideas"),
  caption =
   sprintf("From the %s people responded to this question", paste(ns, collapse = " completed surveys, ")),
  align = 'cl', 
  longtable = T #break the table over multiple pages
  ) %>%
  column_spec(2, width = "5.5in") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, 
                latex_options = c("repeat_header", "hold_position")) 
# use different styling to repeat the header
